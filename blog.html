                <p>Hello. FOUR DAYS BETWEEN AN UPDATE!! WOo!! Such amazingness! Anyways, not much has happened. Or so I think! Well, I guess I should work on some science fair stuff, but coding and blogs is wayyy more fun! Oh well. Worm poop and science. Mucho cools. See ya!</p>
                <p>PS. I don't think there's anything else to say today. Thanks!</p>

                <p>Happy New Years (and Decade??)!!! I'm sorry for such a late update for those of you (if any) who read this. Well, what can I say except that I'm not procrastinating..... I'm just on energy saving mode! Or so I think. I really miss coding and having a reason to code and stop procrastinating and being so gosh darn lazy. But who cares, right? I feel like we're all a little lazy deep down inside. Especially me. I don't know what this looks like, so I'm currently offline. If I end up typing wayyyy more than I should, just skip over the blog part. Or tell me to fix it. Either work!! I think what would be really cool is if one day this coding for fun page could/would be something bigger. Like something people actually read!! Oh! I forgot to tell you why I'm offline (because you totally care, no?). Anyhooo... I'm at school and the internet's down. No, this is not a normal school day. I'm just here because my mother works at my school. Mucho convenience. I'm also kinda bored, soooo... Code!</p>
                <p>PS. I don't think there's anything else to say today. Thanks!</p>

                <p>kay... so, here we go... Today, I finished the gallery (gallery.html) and fixed up the about page as well as this. On 7.18 (or so) I copied all of this code from my summer school site, so that's the explanation of why this is so darn similar to the one I made at the Iolani Summer School course I took. I intend on keeping this going for as long as I can/remember/have time for. I hope you enjoy this site and feel free to go check out my other site that began this whole mess <a href="iwebstudent07.github.io">iwebstudent07.github.io</a>.</p>

                <p>ok, so I have absolutely no idea who's seen this site if anyone really did see this site, but let's pretend someone did and cares about the progression of this site :)) hm...... I think one thing I owe any readers would be a thank you and an apology that I didn't update this blog or site recently. I've started school again and that shall be my wonderful excuse. I hope to work on this site more.</p>
                <p>PS. Please fill out the forms on this and my summer school site. I truly LOVE seeing your responses and they always make my day when they're not malicious:))</p>
