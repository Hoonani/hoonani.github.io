                <p>kay... so, here we go... Today, I finished the gallery (gallery.html) and fixed up the about page as well as this. On 7.18 (or so) I copied all of this code from my summer school site, so that's the explanation of why this is so darn similar to the one I made at the Iolani Summer School course I took. I intend on keeping this going for as long as I can/remember/have time for. I hope you enjoy this site and feel free to go check out my other site that began this whole mess <a href="iwebstudent07.github.io">iwebstudent07.github.io</a>.</p>
                <p>PS. Please fill out the forms on this and my summer school site. I truly LOVE seeing your responses and they always make my day when they're not malicious:))</p>

                <p>ok, so I have absolutely no idea who's seen this site if anyone really did see this site, but let's pretend someone did and cares about the progression of this site :)) hm...... I think one thing I owe any readers would be a thank you and an apology that I didn't update this blog or site recently. I've started school again and that shall be my wonderful excuse. I hope to work on this site more.</p>
